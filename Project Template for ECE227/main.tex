\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) when played on two real world social networks, the undirected Facebook "circles" network and the directed Epinions network with trust signing.
For each network, we implement two classical payoff-based update rules, \emph{imitate best neighbor} and \emph{Fermi}, to observe how cooperation evolves under standard PD dynamics.
The fraction of cooperators and the number of iterations to convergence over three bernoulli initial distributions (\(p \in \{0.25, 0.50, 0.75\}\)) are recorded.
We then introduce two trust aware update rules on the Epinions network, one where agents only consider trusted neighbors when updating strategy and another where agents aggregate trust from all neighbors.
Our results show that in the dense Facebook network, the standard update rules converge rapidly and to moderate levels only when there is high initial cooperation.
The sparse Epinions network, however yields low cooperation and converges slightly slower.
The pairwise trust boosts cooperation significantly, across all initial conditions, while the all-neighbor trust rule drives cooperation above 90\% and converges very quickly.
These results demonstrate that embedding trust into the update rules can drastically enhance both the level and speed of convergence to cooperation, especially in more sparse networks.
